Since Eddie simply forgets his move marching orders, Chandler first spends a night at Monica's but then finds the perfect way to solve both his and Joey's problem. —KGF Vissers", "cover_photo": "/photos/shows/Friends/episodes/S2/MV5BMTg0MDY1NzY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYzMzYzMzE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR93,0,190,281_.jpg"}}, {"model": "media.episode", "pk": "607c131e-6805-429e-9e46-0311ffc7b6fd", "fields": {"imdb_url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0604349/?ref_=ttep_ep1", "show": "bebd8322-b7f6-4d41-8db3-bfb0c2aa49ce", "season": 2, "duration": 47, "imdb_rate": "8.8", "users_rate": null, "episode_number": 1, "release_date": "1994-01-06", "is_released": true, "name": "Bop Gun", "description": "Felton gets a primary case, in which a family gets robbed and the mother is fatally shot.

Everybody is hoping for free stuff, now that Rachel is starting her job with Ralph Lauren. Phoebe suggests they throw an intimate dinner as a surprise birthday party for Rachel, a month in advance, but Monica quickly takes over in grand style; Phoebe insists on being in charge of something, so she gets cups and ice. Rachel quickly finds that her boss Kim and collaborators tend to make all decisions on the balcony during smoking breaks, so after trying just to join them - which doesn't get her close enough - she adopts the terrible habit her dad, a doctor, always warned against with true horror stories. After Ben and Joey are selected for the final cut, Joey is told their lack of physical resemblance means they will be paired with different actors, and only one of them will be cast. Monica's nose and Chandler's experienced eye immediately notice that Rachel has started smoking; she convinces the office girls to attempt quitting together as 'patch sisters', but the others quickly relapse and insist she keep clean - she's out again. Joey's fake offer to waive his audition so that Ross will likewise retract Ben fails. During the final audition, even the line \"Mm, soup!\" is too hard for Joey not to mess up, as he keeps saying \"noodle soup\". Phoebe uses cups and ice in huge quantities and endless, wacky variations to take over much of Monica's party; Ross consoles Joey by suggesting he subconsciously wanted to fail so that Ben's feelings wouldn't be hurt - but the kid didn't get the part either.

One of the friends is just getting into a relationship and two are just getting out of one each. Monica is in the former category, going on a real/not-so-real date, dates with guys she's interested in being a rare occurrence.

Out on their date, their intimate conversation includes the fact that trauma from his last relationship has left him sexually incapable, something that only the right woman like Monica can fix, and she apparently does. Later however she finds that it was just a line to get her into bed, and thus her streak with the \"wrong guy\" continues. Ross is one of the two in the getting out of a relationship category. He and his ex-wife Carol broke up when she found out she was a lesbian. However waltzing into town is his old crush and Monica's best friend from high school Rachel, who is the second friend on a break-up: she has just left her fiancé Barry at the altar, she still in her wedding dress when she first shows up at the coffee house. This move was based on the fact that she realized she was more interested in being married than in being with Mr. Potato Head lookalike Barry.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for  who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in , Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in .Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother  had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band . A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his Funky Bunch and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was born. His debut album, Music for the People, was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping bad boy. Record producer  saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer , Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the 's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, Marky Mark's bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with  and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper , he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, You Gotta Believe, had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the Marky Mark moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in 's . Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In , he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for  who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in , Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in .Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother  had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band . A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his Funky Bunch and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was born. His debut album, Music for the People, was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping bad boy. Record producer  saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer , Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the 's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, Marky Mark's bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with  and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper , he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, You Gotta Believe, had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the Marky Mark moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in 's . Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In , he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial  and chilled them in  as every father's worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in 's .
